An open source hardware project needs the correct licenses for each parts of the documentation. Different licenses can be used for design, hardware, software and documentation. The licenses need to be at least OSHWA compliant: https://www.oshwa.org/definition/.

If the project is already OSHWA certified this verification is obsolete.
